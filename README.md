# E-commerce Customer Segmentation Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques to perform customer segmentation for an e-commerce business. Using a real-world dataset containing over 950,000 transactions from a global e-commerce platform, I applied various data science methodologies to derive actionable insights for improving marketing strategies.

## Business Context
The dataset includes customer transactions from five continents and 47 countries, spanning from January 2012 to December 2016. It contains rich information about customers (location, loyalty status) and their orders (delivery times, costs, profits). The goal is to segment customers effectively to enhance marketing efforts and customer engagement.

## Key Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing of a large, real-world dataset
- Feature engineering to create meaningful customer attributes
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Application of clustering algorithms (K-means, Hierarchical Clustering)
- Dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, t-SNE)
- Determination of optimal cluster numbers using statistical methods
- Visualization of customer segments

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
- Python programming (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Machine Learning model implementation
- Data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Statistical analysis
- Dimensionality reduction techniques
- Clustering algorithms
